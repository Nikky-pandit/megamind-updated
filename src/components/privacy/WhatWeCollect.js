            <ul className="text-left">

                <strong>1. Cookies </strong>
                Megamind Consultants may use standard cookie browser application
                feature to collect and understand Site usability trends. Cookies
                are text files that we may place in your computer browser to store
                your preferences. Cookies are used to record various aspects of
                your visit and assist us in providing you with uninterrupted
                service. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your
                preferences and other information on your computer in order to
                save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same
                information and to display your personalized content. Cookies are
                divided into first party and third party;

                <br /> <br />

                First party cookies are the cookies served by the owner of the
                domain. In our case, thats Megamind Consultants. Any cookie we
                place ourselves is a first-party cookie.

                <br /> <br />

                Third-party cookies are cookies placed on our domains by trusted
                partners that we've allowed to do so. These can be social media
                partners, advertising partners, security providers, and more. And
                they can be either "session cookies" or "permanent cookies":

                <br /> <br />

                Session cookies only exist until you close your browser, ending
                what's called your "session." Then they're deleted.

                <br /> <br />

                Permanent cookies have a range of lifespans and stay on your
                device after the browser is closed. On the Site, we try to only
                serve permanent cookies (or allow permanent cookies to be served
                by third parties) that have a limited lifespan. However, for
                security reasons or in other exceptional circumstances, sometimes
                we may need to give a cookie a longer lifespan.

                <br /> <br />

                Web browser cookies may store info such as your IP address or
                other identifiers, your browser type, and info about the content
                you view and interact with on digital services. By storing this
                info, web browser cookies can remember your preferences and
                settings for online services and analyze how you use them.

                <br /> <br />

                Along with cookies, we also use tracking technologies that are
                very similar. Our Site may contain small transparent image files
                or lines of code that record how you interact with them. These
                include "web beacons," "scripts," "tracking URLs," or "software
                development kits" (known as SDKs):

                <br /> <br />

                Web beacons have a lot of different names. They might also be
                known as web bugs, tracking bugs, tags, web tags, page tags,
                tracking pixels, pixel tags, 1x1 GIFs, or clear GIFs. In short,
                these beacons are a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that can
                be delivered to your device as part of a web page request, in an
                app, an advertisement, or an HTML email message. They can be used
                to retrieve info from your device, such as your device type,
                operating system, IP address, and the time of your visit. They are
                also used to serve and read cookies in your browser or to trigger
                the placement of a cookie.

                <br /> <br />

                Scripts are small computer programs embedded within our web pages
                that give those pages a wide variety of extra functionality.
                Scripts make it possible for the website to function properly. For
                example, scripts power certain security features and enable basic
                interactive features on our website. Scripts can also be used for
                analytical or advertising purposes. For example, a script can
                collect info about how you use our website, such as which pages
                you visit or what you search for. Tracking URLs are links with a
                unique identifier in them. These are used to track which website
                brought you to the Site. An example woold be if you clicked from a
                social media page, search engine, or one of our affiliate
                partners' websites.

                <br/> <br/>

                Software Development Kits (SDKs) are part of our apps' source
                code. Unlike browser cookies, SDK data is stored in the app
                storage. They're used to analyze how the apps are being used or to
                send personalized push notifications. To do this, they record
                unique identifiers associated with your device, like your device
                ID, IP address, in-app activity, and network location. All these
                tracking technologies are referred to as "cookies" here in this
                Cookie Statement.

                <br /> <br />

                However, no Personal Information identifying the user is collected
                nor any data capture mechanisms are employed. The user may change
                browser settings to accept or reject cookies on personal
                preference. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
                Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
                usually modify the browser setting to decline cookies if you so
                prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to
                sign in or use other interactive features of the Site that may
                depend on cookies. If you choose to accept cookies, you also have
                the ability to later delete cookies that you have accepted. If you
                choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled
                by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be
                deleted and may need to be recreated. We process and keep all data
                for our own use and, if you wish to opt-out from tracking by
                Megamind Consultants you can do so at study@megamindonline.com

                other information. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may
                be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information
                with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal
